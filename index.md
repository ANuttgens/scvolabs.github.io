## We're starting a participation revolution by doing good with new technologies.

We think that technology, data and the internet are the key to unlocking a revolution in the way that people get involved in their communities and join in with the charities and causes that they care about.

We believe everybody has something to contribute, so we're focusing on how [platform thinking](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/platform-thinking-approach-innovation/) can redefine social problems and make radical new solutions possible.

We know that the best way to make change happen is to stop talking and start doing. So we're developing exciting new digital projects with huge potential to do good.

### How we work

We're part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk).  Unlike other projects, we're structured and [run like a startup](http://theleanstartup.com/principles). This gives us the space we need to try new things and to give our users our complete attention.

We're inspired by those who put bravery and creativity before playing it safe, and who won't settle for 10 per cent better when 10 times better is possible.

We like to think big, start small and move fast.

And with a bit of luck, we're [just crazy enough](http://www.wired.com/2013/02/moonshots-matter-heres-how-to-make-them-happen/) to have a shot at succeeding.

### Join us

We're looking for talented people to join our team.

You'll need to be entrepreneurial, a great team player, and passionate about the creative application of technology, data and the internet to solve social problems.

In return you'll get to work with like-minded people on challenging projects that will make a real difference to people's lives.

We're hiring people with expertise in:

- Data architecture and analytics
- Mobile-first web development
- UX design and research
- Community engagement
- Project and performance management
